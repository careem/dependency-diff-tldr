# Contributing to dependency-diff-tldr

Careem welcomes contributions to dependency-diff-tldr.

## Workflow

We love GitHub issues!

For small feature requests, an issue first proposing it for discussion or demo implementation in a PR suffice.

For larger features, please open an issue so that we can agree on the direction, and hopefully avoid investing a lot of time on a feature that might need reworking.

Small pull requests for things like typos, bug fixes, etc are always welcome.

### Code style

* Use 2 spaces to indent your code
* Do not use star imports

## Guiding Principles

* We allow anyone to participate in our projects. Tasks can be carried out by anyone that demonstrates the capability to complete them.
* Always be respectful of one another. Assume the best in others and act with empathy at all times.
* Collaborate closely with individuals maintaining the project or experienced users. Getting ideas out in the open and seeing a proposal before it's a pull request helps reduce redundancy and ensures we're all connected to the decision making process.
